# Static Assets Placeholder

This directory is reserved for local image assets (e.g., rock or karesansui logo files) that you do not want to commit to the repository. Place any PNG/JPG files here if you prefer to keep them alongside the project; update the relevant environment variables (e.g., `ROCK_IMAGE_PATH`) to point to your chosen files.

The files `rock_base64.txt` and `karesansui_base64.txt` are the default text-only sources for the rock image and karesansui logo. Populate them with base64-encoded PNG content to ensure the preview uses your preferred assets without storing binaries in git.
