# Static Assets Placeholder

This directory is reserved for local image assets (e.g., rock or karesansui logo files) that you do not want to commit to the repository. Place any PNG/JPG files here if you prefer to keep them alongside the project; update the relevant environment variables (e.g., `ROCK_IMAGE_PATH`, `KARESANSUI_IMAGE_PATH`) to point to your chosen files.
